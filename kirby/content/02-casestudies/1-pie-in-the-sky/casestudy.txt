Challenge: This small, gluten-free baking company had an outdated look that did not match the high-quality of its product. In order to expand its sales to larger supermarkets and specialty stores, the brand's tone and voice needed a sophisticated and delicious look.

----

Solution: Strong Studio evaluated Pie In The Sky's market positioning both locally and nationwide before embarking on a full brand overhaul. We began by updating the logo to a modern, sophisticated mark that still retains a touch of whimsy. Next, we tackled the packaging for the sweet and savory pies, which are the cornerstone of the baking company's business. The packaging highlights the fresh and gluten-free ingredients and establishes a cohesive look across the entire product line. This visual language is carried over to the pieintheskybakery. com website which contains content for both the everyday consumer as well as the wholesale buyer.

----

Results: Since our involvement with updating the visual, our sales have grown over 40%.
