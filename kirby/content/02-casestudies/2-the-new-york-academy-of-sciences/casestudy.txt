Challenge: The New York Academy of Sciences asked Strong Studio to evaluate and update their print collateral with the goal of creating a modern, clean, and cohesive design. With 20,000 members ranging from college students to retired scientists from 100 countries, the look and feel needed to appeal to a wide audience while retaining core branding elements.

Solution: 

Beginning with their 12-page At A Glance folder, Strong Studio revamped the Academy's brand with a more modern typeface, color palette, clean layout and page hierarchy. One of the big challenges was the lack of dynamic photography, which Strong Studio solved by introducing supporting infographics and icons to add visual elements to the page and punctuating the often dense text. The success of this project led the Academy to ask Strong Studio to update and manage all of its upcoming print collateral in each of their many departments.

Strong Studio continues to work with the Academy of Sciences on a daily basis, updating and maintaining their refreshed brand.
