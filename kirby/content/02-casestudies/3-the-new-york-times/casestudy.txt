Challenge: Since its launch in 1998, the New York Times Store has continued to grow into an important revenue-generating brand extension. In an effort to appeal to a broader market and elevate the shopping experience, the Store asked Strong Studio to update the look and feel of its online marketplace and print and digital advertising.

----

Solution: 

Beginning with a Holiday Gift Guide, Strong Studio revamped the Store's print and digital holiday campaign with a polished aesthetic that organized its eclectic offerings in a clean, modern environment. We then extended the look beyond the holidays to its daily newspaper and digital advertising, including eblasts, web banners, and multi-page print advertisements.

Strong Studio continues to work with The New York Times Store on new product development.
